## Artemis Financial Software Security Assessment
### Client and Software Requirements
Artemis Financial is a financial services company that provides investment management and advisory services to its clients. The company's software system manages the investment portfolios of its clients and their corresponding transactions. The client wanted to identify potential vulnerabilities in the software system to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.

### Finding Software Vulnerabilities
During the software security assessment, we identified several vulnerabilities that could have potentially exposed sensitive client data. We were able to identify these vulnerabilities by conducting a comprehensive security assessment that included testing the software for common exploits, using vulnerability scanners, and analyzing the code for known security issues.

### Importance of Software Security
It is important to code securely because software vulnerabilities can lead to data breaches, which can have severe consequences for a company's reputation and financial health. By addressing vulnerabilities proactively, we can help prevent data breaches and protect our client's reputation.

### Challenging Aspects of the Vulnerability Assessment
One of the most challenging aspects of the vulnerability assessment was identifying potential attack vectors and determining the severity of the vulnerabilities. This required a deep understanding of the software system and knowledge of common exploits and attack methods.

### Increasing Layers of Security
We increased layers of security by implementing best practices for software security, such as input validation, secure authentication, and proper error handling. In the future, we would use a combination of vulnerability scanners and manual testing to identify potential vulnerabilities and determine the best mitigation techniques.

### Ensuring Functional and Secure Code
After refactoring the code, we conducted thorough testing to ensure the software was functional and secure. We used a combination of automated testing tools and manual testing to validate the code changes and check for new vulnerabilities.

### Resources and Tools Used
We used several tools and practices during the software security assessment, including vulnerability scanners, code review tools, and manual testing techniques. We also used best practices for secure coding, such as input validation, secure authentication, and error handling.

### Examples for Future Employers
This assignment provides an example of my ability to identify software vulnerabilities and implement best practices for software security. I can demonstrate my knowledge of secure coding practices, vulnerability scanning techniques, and manual testing methods to potential employers.
